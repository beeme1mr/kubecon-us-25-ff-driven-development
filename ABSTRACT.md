# Feature Flag Driven Development: Seamlessly Integrate Feature Flags Into Your SDLC

Feature flags decouple deployment from release, enabling safe rollouts and continuous delivery.But at scale, they introduce challenges: drift between environments, inconsistent definitions, and runtime bugs from undefined or mistyped flags. At one of the largest health systems in the US, daily releases using feature flags boosted delivery speed but exposed risks due to poor flag hygiene. To address this, we created Feature Flag Driven Development (FFDD); a workflow that embeds flag management into the SDLC. This talk introduces FFDD, a practice that treats feature flags as first-class citizens. Built on the CNCF OpenFeature spec and tools like the OpenFeature CLI, FFDD eliminates manual coordination, reduces errors, and enables GitOps-driven promotion. We’ll demo the full FFDD flow: defining flags, generating type-safe code, validating in CI, syncing flags, and promoting safely across environments using GitHub Actions.
